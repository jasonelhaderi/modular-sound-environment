# modular-sound-environment
A suite of patches in Pure Data for experiments in modular sound design. Includes raw filters, oscillators, sequencer, other essentials for easy design of new patches from the ground up, as well as two fully integrated synthesizers:
* The Modular Sound Unit (msu~.pd) is a basic, standalone unit. It's origin was for the deployment of multiple copys dialed in to different tones for the development of soundscapes. It derives its flexibility from its simplicity.
* The Modular Synthesizer  (synth_modular~.pd) is precisely what it sounds like; it is a traditional modular synthesizer.
